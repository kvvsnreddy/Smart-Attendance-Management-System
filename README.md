## Project Overview

The **Smart Attendance Management System** uses a webcam to capture live video, detects faces in the video feed, recognizes individuals by comparing detected faces with a pre-trained dataset, and logs attendance records into a database.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces from live video or images.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes individuals based on pre-trained datasets.
- **Attendance Logging**: Stores attendance records in a SQLite database or CSV file.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple GUI using Tkinter or PyQt for ease of use (optional).
- **Security**: Ensures privacy by encrypting sensitive data.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and image processing.
- **face_recognition**: For face recognition tasks.
- **SQLite**: To store attendance records.
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI (optional).
